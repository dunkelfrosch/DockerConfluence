# Docker Image for Atlassian Confluence

*this documentation isn't fully done yet - we're still working on major and minor issues corresponding to this repository base!*

This repository provides the latest version of Atlassians collaboration software [Confluence](https://de.atlassian.com/software/confluence) including the recommended [MySQL java connector](http://dev.mysql.com/get/Downloads/Connector-J/mysql-connector-java-5.1.36.tar.gz) for an easy and painless docker based Confluence installation. Take note that this repository will be used inside our docker atlassian application workbench sources, which are also available on [Github](https://github.com/dunkelfrosch/docker-atlassian-wb) as soon as documentation is completed. *In this workbench we've combined several Atlassian products (Confluence, Confluence and Bitbucket) using advanced docker features like docker-compose based service management, data-container and links*

## Preparation
We recommend the [latest Docker version](https://github.com/docker/docker/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md). For simple system integration and supervision we suggest [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/). If you're using MacOS or Windows as host operating system, you may take the advantage of [Docker Machine](https://www.docker.com/docker-machine) for Docker's VM management. Confluence requires a relational database like MySQL or PostgreSQL, so we'll provide a specific Docker Compose configuration file to showcase both a Confluence-MySQL link and a data-container feature configuration. Use the installation guides of provided links down below to comply your Docker preparation process.

[docker-compose installation guide](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/)</br>
[docker machine installation guide](https://docs.docker.com/machine/install-machine/)</br>


## Installation-Method 1, using docker
These steps will show you the generic, pure docker-based installation of Atlassian Confluence image/container, without any database container linked or data-container feature.  *We also will provide (and recommend) a docker-compose based installation in this documentation (â†— Installation-Method 2)*.

1) checkout this repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/dunkelfrosch/docker-confluence.git .
```

2.1) build your Confluence image (version 6.12.2) on your local docker host, naming image "dunkelfrosch/confluence:6.12.2"

```bash
docker build -t dunkelfrosch/confluence:6.12.2 -t dunkelfrosch/confluence:latest .
```

2.2) pull our compiled Confluence image from docker-hub directly by activating the corresponding lines in our docker-compose.yml file below the "restart: always" line: "image: df/dunkelfrosch-confluence"


3) start your new confluence application container

```bash
docker run -d -p 8090:8090 dunkelfrosch/confluence 
```
	
4. finish your installation using atlassian's browser based configuration
just navigate to `http://[dockerhost]:8090`. Please take note, that your dockerhost will depend on your host system. If you're using docker on your mac, you'll properly using docker-machine or the deprecated native boot2docker vbox image. In this case your 'dockerhost' ip will be the vbox ones (just enter `docker-machine ls` and grab your named machine's ip from there. In my case (image down below) the resulting setup-ip will be <strong>192.168.99.100:8080</strong> on any other "real" linux system the setup-ip should be 127.0.0.1/localhost (port will be the tomcat application used port 8090)

4.1 The following steps will help you to finalize your confluence server web-based configuration

*we'll update the web-based configuration documentation (including screenshots of the latest setup version) within the next view days*

## Installation-Method 2, via Docker Compose (simple)
The following steps will show you an alternative way of your Confluence service container installation using Docker Compose

1) checkout this repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/dunkelfrosch/docker-confluence.git .
```
 
2.1) create/use a docker-compose.yml file in your target directory (or use the existing one), afterwards insert the following lines (docker-compose.yml in *./sample-configs/* directory). 

2.2) you can also pull our compiled Confluence image from docker-hub directly, see step 2.2 of installation method 1 

3) start your Confluence container by docker-compose

```bash
docker-compose up -d confluence
```

4) (*optional*) rename the resulting image after successful build (we'll use our image auto-name result here)

```bash
docker tag dfdockerconfluence_confluence dunkelfrosch/confluence:6.12.2
```

5) the result should by a running container and an available local Confluence image


## Installation-Method 3, docker-compose (using db)
Confluence needs a relational DB and for safety reasons we suggest using data-only container features. Take a look inside your *./sample-config* path, we've provided a few sample docker-compose.yml config files below to show you those feature implementations.

./sample-configs/**docker-compose-dc.yml**
> sample configuration for data-container feature

./sample-configs/**docker-compose-linkdb.yml**
> sample configuration for linking mysql container directly

./sample-configs/**docker-compose-dc-v2.yml**
> new docker compose formatted sample configuration for data-container feature

./sample-configs/**docker-compose-linkdb-v2.yml**
> new docker compose formatted sample configuration for linking mysql container directly

./sample-configs/**docker-compose-netdb-v2.yml**
> sample configuration for new networking feature connected mysql/confluence container


## container access and maintenance
You can check container health by accessing logs of inner Tomcat/Confluence processes directly as long as the container is still running. As you can see in this screenshot, Atlassian Confluence was starting successfully (*Let's ignore some minor warnings ;)* )

```bash
docker logs df-atls-confluence
```

You can log in easily to your running Confluence container to take a deeper look in your Confluence service process. *This Confluence build provides midnight-commander as terminal extension accessible typing `mc` in your container session shell*.

```bash
docker exec -it --user root df-atls-confluence /bin/bash
```
